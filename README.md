# Diffusion Models

Highlights
1) Trained a diffusion model using Hugging Face's diffusers library to generate visually impressive butterfly images.
2) Used a noise scheduler to add noise to 1000 high-quality butterfly images and trained a UNet architecture for denoising.
3) Employed the backward denoising process, optimizing the model parameters using AdamW optimizer and minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss function.

Summary
DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) is a type of generative model that can learn to generate realistic images by estimating the probability distribution of the data. DDPMs use a diffusion process to transform a random noise signal into an image that is close to the target distribution. In the diffusion process, noise is gradually added to the signal, and the signal is then denoised using a neural network. By iteratively adding noise and denoising, the model can learn to generate high-quality images that match the target distribution.

Stable diffusion is a modification of the diffusion process used in DDPMs to improve their stability and performance. In stable diffusion, the amount of noise added to the signal is adaptively adjusted at each step to ensure that the signal remains close to the target distribution. This adaptation is done by monitoring the signal's gradient and scaling the noise accordingly. Stable diffusion can help avoid numerical instability and ensure that the diffusion process converges to the target distribution efficiently.

In this project, a diffusion model was trained using Hugging Face's diffusers library to generate stunning butterfly images. To improve the quality of the images generated by the diffusion model, a UNet architecture was trained for denoising using a noise scheduler that added noise to 1000 clean butterfly images. The backward denoising process was implemented using the AdamW optimizer and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function to update the model parameters. Overall, this approach allowed for the generation of visually impressive butterfly images with improved quality and clarity. 

Stay tuned for more. Cheers!
